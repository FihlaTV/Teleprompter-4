# Teleprompter

This project was born when I found myself struggling with a bunch of apps in Google Play Store. 

I was looking for a simple Teleprompter application, that I could use during my performances as a musician.

The concept is very simple: 
I need to see the lyrics of the song on my device's screen and somehow I don't want to interact with it while I'm still playing.

With this simple requirement, I developed a system that is totally flexible. Now I can play and sing having this technology that helps me remember the lyrics.

The system works with timers. Every moment that the singer feels that the screen must stop prompting, he or she just need to add the time (in seconds) that the screen must freeze and then the time that the screen must animate the lyric.

The singer can add as much timer that he or she wants and configure it specifically for each song. That's it!

For developers (and possible musicians) that want to contribute with this open source project, please fell free to email me.
